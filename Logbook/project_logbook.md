# Project Logbook

This logbook records the ongoing development of the ECET-230 project, including decisions, testing, and progress updates.

## Initial Planning
Reviewed project requirements and identified major subsystems. Selected a microcontroller-based approach to simplify control logic and system integration.

## Design Decisions
Decided to use push buttons for input and LEDs with a buzzer for output. This choice keeps the design simple and reliable while still meeting functional requirements.

## Implementation Progress
Created the project repository and organized documentation into folders. Drafted initial design decision, project definition, and task documents.

## Testing and Adjustments
Future entries will document breadboard testing, wiring changes, software debugging, and any modifications made to improve system performance.
