# Project Definition

## High-Level Description
This project is an embedded electronic system designed to interact with a user through buttons, visual indicators, and sound. The system processes user input and provides feedback based on programmed logic.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a functional microcontroller-based system using concepts learned in ECET-230. The project emphasizes system organization, documentation, and hardware-software integration.

## Objectives
- Design a complete electronic system using a block diagram
- Implement the system using breadboard-level components
- Demonstrate correct input processing and output control
- Maintain clear engineering documentation

## User Interaction
The user interacts with the system through push buttons. The system responds using LEDs and a buzzer to provide clear feedback.

## System Components
- Inputs: Push buttons
- Processing: Microcontroller
- Outputs: LEDs and buzzer
- Power: Low-voltage DC supply

## Constraints
The system must be implementable on a breadboard using discrete components or development modules. All design choices must be feasible within the scope of the course.
